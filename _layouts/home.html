    <h2>Hi, I'm Tim</h2>
    <p>
       My experience spans nearly 30 years in tech from the server room to the cloud,
      from scrappy startups to large enterprises. I still find this industry
      genuinely intriguing, and often tiresome. Today I work as a solutions architect,
      helping teams build systems that are resilient, cost-conscious, and actually
      pleasant to operate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I care deeply about sustainable engineering. Not just the architecture, but
      the people building it. That means advocating for practices that support
      mental health, growth, and long-term careers, not just fast deploys.
    </p>
    <p>
      I speak and sit on panels regularly, bring deep DevOps and SRE experience to
      every conversation, and am known for being refreshingly direct. If you've
      wondered what someone with 30 years of opinions and no remaining patience for
      cargo-culting actually thinks about the industry then this is the blog for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of tech, I'm a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt and 10-time international
      champion. The mat teaches the same lessons the job does: fundamentals matter,
      shortcuts bite you later, and the only way out is through.
