So, I have, once again, done a reboot of my blog. None of the "New Year, new blog" bullshit - just some refocusing. Firstly, I've switched from Wordpress to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). This allows me to create my posts in a text or code editor (I've become fairly enamored with [Atom](https://atom.io/)) or good ol' vim.  

I've been hacking away at python automation projects for work, digging into [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)(including some of the new additions of beats), and digging into containerization through [Docker](http://www.docker.com/). I'll post about all of my fun stuff as time goes on.  

It's not just about the code, though. It's also about making good decisions with the technology you're working with, and the resources and people that you have. The things that you create mean less if they aren't used, or used the right way. I'll be talking about that later, too.

I will *probably* not talk about politics, but maybe only inasmuch as it affects tech. I will talk about food (lots of food), bikes, family life and other boring things. But don't worry, I'll try not to make it too tedious.
