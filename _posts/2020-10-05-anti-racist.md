# i imagine all kinds of scenarios
where i stand up to various types of blatant, over-the-top racism. you know, like some dude getting out of a pickup truck with a bunch of trump stickers on it, calling me a nigger to my face and me choking him unconscious. 
something very clear-cut and emotionally neat. 
the kind of stuff that i _w i s h_ a motherfucker would. oh, that things would ever be that easy.

instead, i am quite often presented with scenarios that are far more subtle, confusing, and unnerving. things that make me uncomfortable both in the moment and later on as i relive the incident in my head.
the fallout is complex and affects not just me, but others around me.
such a scenario happened to me recently and i will relate it to you, dear reader.

i was meeting married friends of my partner at their house one weekend evening, and struck a good rapport with the husband in the couple over cars. 
i am a bit of a gearhead myself, and i had familiarity with the car that he was working on in his garage. so we chatted pleasantly and had a good time. later, we went inside and talked with the women and, again, everyone was having a good time and talking about all sorts of things. telling stories, misadventures, sex, drugs, rock & roll, and that sort of thing. i was feeling pretty comfortable, considering The Situation*.

*The Situation is where you meet white people in their house and you're the only person of color in the group. pretty much any POC will understand why this will be always be a factor.

we went out on the patio to talk while watching the sunset, and we were talking about something, and i made a remark about being the first one to run away if some bad thing we were discussing happened. then the husband said:

***"c'mon, it's not like you're Black. you won't be the first one to die in a horror movie."***

and, let me tell you, i was't ready for that. and it's problematic on several levels. let's dig in.

first of all (and in the words of one of my partner's friends), what stereotypes about Black people was this man buying into for him to think that i wasn't Black? how "Black" do i have to be in order to considered "Black" by this man? and then, like, why tf does this guy feel comfortable saying something like that if he thinks i'm not Black? what else would he say if we pursued that line of conversation?

i felt struck, and _very_ self conscious. was i still safe here? was i only admitted under false pretenses? if he knew i was Black, what would his demeanor have been this whole time? all this went through my head in an instant and i didn't know what to do. all these scenarios i'd rehearsed in my head, all these situations where i had strategized the exact right thing to do, and, yet, i was unprepared.

at this point, i must tell you that my partner was **amazing** because the caught the change in my body language and demeanor (which i thought i had hidden) and texted me asking if i was okay, what i needed, and how can she help. i waas still rather dumbstruck. the husband, clueless to it all and continuing to talk. i messaged her back saying it was fine and we could stay.
