# if you heard my podcast appearance
on the [blameless resilience in action podcast](https://www.blameless.com/blog/resilience-in-action-episode-2), you heard me mention escoffier's [brigade system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade_de_cuisine). as a brief refresher, the brigade system is the martially regimented heirarchy in the kitchen, from chef de cuisine at the top, to commis at the bottom. i made the point that the brigade system was extremely non-inclusive and would weed out people that didn't do well in that system, regardless of their ability to actually cook well.

in his appearance on the [sporkful podcast](http://www.sporkful.com/10-years-4-notes-from-a-young-black-chef-pt-1/), chef Kwame Onwuachi also talks about the brigade system and how it lends itself to abuse by those with authority. this abuse can take the form of misogyny, racism, verbal abuse, unsafe working conditions, unreasonably long hours, and sometimes physical abuse. in his case, he was the victim of racism in one of the kitchens where he was a commis.

the brigade system is, by its very nature, abusive. it is heirarchal and authoritarian, with the junior roles doing grueling, menial labor. survival is rewarded with the opportunity to do different grueling labor. add to this the swift punishments for questioning authority, a blind eye turned to abuses by others in the system, and the financial and career incentives for playing along with such a system, and you end up with a situation not unlike the one that killed George Floyd.

the thing with the brigade system is, it weeds people out of the kitchen based on criteria that have exactly _nothing_ to do with their ability to create and prepare excellent food. instead, people that can endure in that environment are taught how to cook. up until fairly recently, this was what you saw in most fine dining kitchens and certainly in any kitchen at a michelin star establishment. if you wanted to be established in the culinary field, you had to endure this environment.

so, who was weeded out? women. people of color. lgbtq+ folks. neurodivergent people. victims of abuse or other types or trauma. older people entering the field. 
who thrived? typically white males. who then groomed and promoted other white males. does this pattern sound familiar?

what does this have to do with tech? well, very simply, the gatekeeping, intern exploitation, draconian interview methods, the hostility towards women, bipoc, and lgbtq+ folks, and other abusive practices are just a different implementation of the brigade system. certainly without militaristic regimentation (although, many of the narratives in some startups seem pretty close), but the toxic results of the environment are still the same. the tech brigade system uses gatekeeping, intimidation, long hours, torturous interviews, and "culture fit" to push people out of the industry using criteria that have nothing to do with a person's ability to do the *actual* job.
