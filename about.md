Tim is a DevOps engineer at ObjectRocket who has been (more or less) in the IT field for almost 20 years. He is a husband and father of 4, former chef (and still so at home from time to time), avid cyclist, and brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner. All opinions are his, his alone, and sometimes, those of his wife, who may or may not be looking over his shoulder.
